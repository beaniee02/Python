What is inbuilt python function? with examples
What is concatenation with examples
What is a variable




Built-in functions are the pre-defined function in Python that allows using the basic properties of string and numbers in your rules. Examples are: sum(), type(), min(), max(), str()

Concatenation is the joining of two or more strings to form a new string.
print('My' + 'name' + 'is' + 'busola')

A variable serves as a container for storing values.

str.lower(): it conerts all characters of the string to lowercase.
str.title(): it converts the first letter of every word to uppercase
str.split(separator): it splits the string into a list where each word is a list item.
str.join(iterable): joins the elements of an iterable(e.g. a list) into a single string, with the string acting as a separator
str.find(substring): returns the lowest index where the substring is found or -1 if it is not found
str.startswith(substring) and str.endswith(substring): it checks whether the string starts or ends with the specified substring
str.isdigit(): returns true if all characters in the string are alphabetic
str.isalnum(): it returns true if all characters in the string are alphanumeric (letters and numbers)
str.count(substring): it returns the number of occurences of the substring in the string
str.zfill(width): pads the string on the left with zeros untill it reaches the specified width.
